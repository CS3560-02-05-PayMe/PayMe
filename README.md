The construction of our project involved employing specific methodologies and utilizing React with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for designing the front end. The connection between the front end and back end was facilitated through the Spring Framework, with a focus on Spring Boot. The back end communicated with a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval. Discord served as our real-time communication platform for team collaboration, enabling instant messaging and voice calls. GitHub was utilized for project collaboration, allowing team members to contribute code, track changes, and manage tasks through features like pull requests and commits. The decision to use Spring Boot for the backend implementation was driven by its open-source nature, Java-based framework, ease of project initiation, flexibility in managing dependencies, and convenient project organization, making it well-suited for our team with Java expertise.
