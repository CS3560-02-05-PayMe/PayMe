To test/run this website on local devices:
1. Install **node.js** version **18.6** or **18.7+** (I forgot which but if you download the latest version, there should be no problems). 
2. Run `npm install -g yarn` to install Yarn package manager (Yarn over NPM because of performance and security issues)
3. Start website with `yarn run dev` and it will be running on http://localhost:3000
